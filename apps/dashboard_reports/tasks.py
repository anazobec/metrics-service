Background tasks for dashboard reports data collection and cleanup.

- collect_dashboard_reports_initial_data: full historical backfill (window from the Controller's retention schedule, default 90 days)
- backfill_dashboard_organization_names: one-time fix of JobData rows missing organization_name
- collect_dashboard_reports_data: incremental sync from last known timestamp (deprecated)
- sync_dashboard_job_records: writes unified_jobs data from the hourly hook to JobData
- sync_dashboard_host_summaries: writes host summary data from the hourly hook to JobHostSummary
- sync_dashboard_on_demand: manually runs both sync paths for a time window
- cleanup_dashboard_reports_old_data: removes JobData records beyond retention period
